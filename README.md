# Locations-Algorithm
-------
In this project, we have to alocate the driver location according to specific algorithm. Wherever we know that the driver will be impossible to be, we will never go there and searching for him/her. This algorithm increases the efficiency of our software and the response time will be decreased.
Programming language used: Java
